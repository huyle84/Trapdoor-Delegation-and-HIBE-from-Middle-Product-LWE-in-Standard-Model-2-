abstract="A broadcast encryption scheme allows the sender to securely distribute data to a dynamically changing set of users over an insecure channel. One of the most challenging settings for this problem is that of stateless receivers, where each user is given a fixed set of keys which cannot be updated through the lifetime of the system. This setting was considered by Naor, Naor and Lotspiech [17], who also present a very efficient ``Subset Difference'' (SD) method for solving this problem. The efficiency of this method (which also enjoys efficient traitor tracing mechanism and several other useful features) was recently improved by Halevi and Shamir [12], who called their refinement the ``Layered SD'' (LSD) method. Both of the above methods were originally designed to work in the centralized symmetric key setting, where only the trusted designer of the system can encrypt messages to users. On the other hand, in many applications it is desirable not to store the secret keys ``on-line'', or to allow untrusted users to broadcast information. This leads to the question of building a public key broadcast encryption scheme for stateless receivers; in particular, of extending the elegant SD/LSD methods to the public key setting. Naor et al. [17] notice that the natural technique for doing so will result in an enormous public key and very large storage for every user. In fact, [17] pose this question of reducing the public key size and user's storage as the first open problem of their paper. We resolve this question in the affirmative, by demonstrating that an O(1) size public key can be achieved for both of SD/LSD methods, in addition to the same (small) user's storage and ciphertext size as in the symmetric key setting.",

abstract="We introduce the concept of hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) schemes, give precise definitions of their security and mention some applications. A two-level HIBE (2-HIBE) scheme consists of a root private key generator (PKG), domain PKGs and users, all of which are associated with primitive IDs (PIDs) that are arbitrary strings. A user's public key consists of their PID and their domain's PID (in whole called an address). In a regular IBE (which corresponds to a 1-HIBE) scheme, there is only one PKG that distributes private keys to each user (whose public keys are their PID). In a 2-HIBE, users retrieve their private key from their domain PKG. Domain PKGs can compute the private key of any user in their domain, provided they have previously requested their domain secret key from the root PKG (who possesses a master secret). We can go beyond two levels by adding subdomains, subsubdomains, and so on. We present a two-level system with total collusion resistance at the upper (domain) level and partial collusion resistance at the lower (user) level, which has chosen-ciphertext security in the random-oracle model.",

The scheme assumes the existence of trusted key generation centers, whose sole purpose is to give each user a personalized smart card when he first joins the network. The information embedded in this card enables the user to sign and encrypt the messages he sends and to decrypt and verify the messages he receives in a totally independent way, regardless of the identity of the other party. Previously issued cards do not have to be updated when new users join the network, and the various centers do not have to coordinate their activities or even to keep a user list. The centers can be closed after all the cards are issued, and the network can continue to function in a completely decentralized way for an indefinite period.",

This result immediately yielded very efficient one-way functions whose security was based on worst-case hardness assumptions. In this work, we show that, while the function proposed by Micciancio is not collision resistant, it can be easily modified to achieve collision resistance under essentially the same complexity assumptions on cyclic lattices. Our modified function is obtained as a special case of a more general result, which yields efficient collision-resistant hash functions based on the worst-case hardness of various new problems. These include new problems from algebraic number theory as well as classic lattice problems (e.g., the shortest vector problem) over ideal lattices, a class of lattices that includes cyclic lattices as a special case.",

abstract="Middle-product learning with errors (MP-LWE) was recently introduced by Rosca, Sakzad, Steinfeld and Stehl{\'e} (CRYPTO 2017) as a way to combine the efficiency of Ring-LWE with the more robust security guarantees of plain LWE. While Ring-LWE is at the heart of efficient lattice-based cryptosystems, it involves the choice of an underlying ring which is essentially arbitrary. In other words, the effect of this choice on the security of Ring-LWE is poorly understood. On the other hand, Rosca et al. showed that a new LWE variant, called MP-LWE, is as secure as Polynomial-LWE (another variant of Ring-LWE) over any of a broad class of number fields. They also demonstrated the usefulness of MP-LWE by constructing an MP-LWE based public-key encryption scheme whose efficiency is comparable to Ring-LWE based public-key encryption. In this work, we take this line of research further by showing how to construct Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) schemes that are secure under a variant of the MP-LWE assumption. Our IBE schemes match the efficiency of Ring-LWE based IBE, including a scheme in the random oracle model with keys and ciphertexts of size {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n){\$}{\$} (for n-bit identities).",

Fortunately, for static groups, it is possible to integrate the blindness of message into group/ring signatures.

Then, it is widely used in e-cash and voting, especially in the revolutionary digital cash system based on blockchain. In our paper, we present a method to construct a post-quantum blind signature based on lattice assumptions, and we proved that any existential forger against the security of the resulting scheme can solve the SISq,n,m,βproblem for β = Õ(dn). Our main technique is the rejection sampling theory. The expected number of times needed to output a blind signature is at most e2under aborting, and our new scheme has much smaller signature size than those of all the previously proposed blind signature schemes over lattices.},

	abstract="Blind signatures (BS), introduced by Chaum, have become a cornerstone in privacy-oriented cryptography. Using hard lattice problems, such as the shortest vector problem, as the basis of security has advantages over using the factoring or discrete logarithm problems. For instance, lattice operations are more efficient than modular exponentiation and lattice problems remain hard for quantum and subexponential-time adversaries. Generally speaking, BS allow a signer to sign a message without seeing it, while retaining a certain amount of control over the process. In particular, the signer can control the number of issued signatures. For the receiver of the signature, this process provides perfect anonymity, e.g., his spendings remain anonymous when using BS for electronic money.",

	abstract="In this paper, we investigate a variant of the BKZ algorithm, called progressive BKZ, which performs BKZ reductions by starting with a small blocksize and gradually switching to larger blocks as the process continues. We discuss techniques to accelerate the speed of the progressive BKZ algorithm by optimizing the following parameters: blocksize, searching radius and probability for pruning of the local enumeration algorithm, and the constant in the geometric series assumption (GSA). We then propose a simulator for predicting the length of the Gram-Schmidt basis obtained from the BKZ reduction. We also present a model for estimating the computational cost of the proposed progressive BKZ by considering the efficient implementation of the local enumeration algorithm and the LLL algorithm. Finally, we compare the cost of the proposed progressive BKZ with that of other algorithms using instances from the Darmstadt SVP Challenge. The proposed algorithm is approximately 50 times faster than BKZ 2.0 (proposed by Chen-Nguyen) for solving the SVP Challenge up to 160 dimensions.",

abstract="To date the NTRUEncrypt security parameters have been based on the existence of two types of attack: a meet-in-the-middle attack due to Odlyzko, and a conservative extrapolation of the running times of the best (known) lattice reduction schemes to recover the private key. We show that there is in fact a continuum of more efficient attacks between these two attacks. We show that by combining lattice reduction and a meet-in-the-middle strategy one can reduce the number of loops in attacking the NTRUEncrypt private key from 284.2 to 260.3, for the k{\thinspace}={\thinspace}80 parameter set. In practice the attack is still expensive (dependent on ones choice of cost-metric), although there are certain space/time tradeoffs that can be applied. Asymptotically our attack remains exponential in the security parameter k, but it dictates that NTRUEncrypt parameters must be chosen so that the meet-in-the-middle attack has complexity 2keven after an initial lattice basis reduction of complexity 2k.",

abstract="In 1996, Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman introduced an efficient lattice based encryption scheme dubbed NTRUEncrypt. Unfortunately, this scheme lacks a proof of security. However, in 2011, Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld showed how to modify NTRUEncrypt to reduce security to standard problems in ideal lattices. In 2012, L{\'o}pez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

abstract="In this paper, we describe a three-stage attack against Revised NSS, an NTRU-based signature scheme proposed at the Eurocrypt 2001 conference as an enhancement of the (broken) proceedings version of the scheme. The first stage, which typically uses a transcript of only 4 signatures, effectively cuts the key length in half while completely avoiding the intended hard lattice problem. After an empirically fast second stage, the third stage of the attack combines lattice-based and congruence-based methods in a novel way to recover the private key in polynomial time. This cryptanalysis shows that a passive adversary observing only a few valid signatures can recover the signer's entire private key. We also briefly address the security of NTRUSign, another NTRU-based signature scheme that was recently proposed at the rump session of Asiacrypt 2001. As we explain, some of our attacks on Revised NSS may be extended to NTRUSign, but a much longer transcript is necessary. We also indicate how the security of NTRUSign is based on the hardness of several problems, not solely on the hardness of the usual NTRU lattice problem.",

But when the lattice is given with enough symmetry, we can construct a provably deterministic polynomial time algorithm to accomplish this, based on the work of Gentry and Szydlo. The techniques involve algorithmic algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, commutative algebra, and lattice basis reduction. This sheds new light on the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm, and the ideas should be applicable to a range of questions in cryptography.",

	abstract="In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.",

	abstract = { Big data technologies are increasingly used for biomedical and health-care informatics research. Large amounts of biological and clinical data have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For example, the new generation of sequencing technologies enables the processing of billions of DNA sequence data per day, and the application of electronic health records (EHRs) is documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and analyzing biomedical data is expected to decrease dramatically with the help of technology upgrades, such as the emergence of new sequencing machines, the development of novel hardware and software for parallel computing, and the extensive expansion of EHRs. Big data applications present new opportunities to discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of health care. The application of big data in health care is a fast-growing field, with many new discoveries and methodologies published in the last five years. In this paper, we review and discuss big data application in four major biomedical subdisciplines: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical informatics, (3) imaging informatics, and (4) public health informatics. Specifically, in bioinformatics, high-throughput experiments facilitate the research of new genome-wide association studies of diseases, and with clinical informatics, the clinical field benefits from the vast amount of collected patient data for making intelligent decisions. Imaging informatics is now more rapidly integrated with cloud platforms to share medical image data and workflows, and public health informatics leverages big data techniques for predicting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. In this paper, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of big data applications in these health-care domains and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance big data applications in health care. }

In this paper, we show that for an LWR{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}m,n,q,p{\}}({\backslash}chi {\_}s){\$}{\$}instance whose parameters satisfy a certain sufficient condition, one can use the BDD strategy to recover the secret with higher advantages if one transforms the LWR instance to an LWE modulo {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}instance with {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}chosen appropriately instead of an LWE modulo q instance. The optimal modulus {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}used in our BDD attack is quite close to p as well as typically smaller than q. Especially, our experiments confirm that our BDD attack is much better in solving search-LWR in terms of root Hermite factor, success probability and even running time either in case the ratio {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log (q)/ {\backslash}log (p){\$}{\$}is big or/and the dimension n is sufficiently large.",

	abstract="Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool in cryptanalysis. In 2017, DeepBKZ was proposed as a new variant of BKZ, and it calls LLL with deep insertions (DeepLLL) as a subroutine alternative to LLL. In this paper, we develop a dual version of DeepBKZ (which we call ``Dual-DeepBKZ''), to reduce the dual basis of an input basis. For Dual-DeepBKZ, we develop a dual version of DeepLLL, and then combine it with the dual enumeration by Micciancio and Walter. It never computes the dual basis of an input basis, and it is as efficient as the primal DeepBKZ. We also demonstrate that Dual-DeepBKZ solves several instances in the TU Darmstadt LWE challenge. We use Dual-DeepBKZ in the bounded distance decoding (BDD) approach for solving an LWE instance. Our experiments show that Dual-DeepBKZ reduces the cost of Liu-Nguyen's BDD enumeration more effectively than BKZ. For the LWE instance of {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (40, 0.015){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(40,0.015)(resp., {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (60, 0.005){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(60,0.005)), our results are about 2.2 times (resp., 4.0 times) faster than Xu et al.'s results, for which they used BKZ in the fplll library and the BDD enumeration with extreme pruning while we used linear pruning in our experiments.",

The underlying cryptosystem serves as the equivalent of a ``hardware platform'' for HElib, in that it defines a set of operations that can be applied homomorphically, and specifies their cost. This ``platform'' is a SIMD environment (somewhat similar to Intel SSE and the like), but with unique cost metrics and parameters. In this report we describe some of the algorithms and optimization techniques that are used in HElib for data movement, linear algebra, and other operations over this ``platform.''",

To date, it remains the only known way of obtaining unbounded FHE. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is computationally very expensive, despite the great deal of effort that has been spent on improving its efficiency. The current state of the art, due to Gentry, Halevi, and Smart (PKC 2012), is able to bootstrap ``packed'' ciphertexts (which encrypt up to a linear number of bits) in time only quasilinear {\~O}($\lambda$) = $\lambda$ {\textperiodcentered} logO(1) $\lambda$ in the security parameter. While this performance is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors, the practical import is less clear: the procedure composes multiple layers of expensive and complex operations, to the point where it appears very difficult to implement, and its concrete runtime appears worse than those of prior methods (all of which have quadratic or larger asymptotic runtimes).",

Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block.

	abstract="In 2003, Schnorr introduced Random sampling to find very short lattice vectors, as an alternative to enumeration. An improved variant has been used in the past few years by Kashiwabara et al. to solve the largest Darmstadt SVP challenges. However, the behaviour of random sampling and its variants is not well-understood: all analyses so far rely on a questionable heuristic assumption, namely that the lattice vectors produced by some algorithm are uniformly distributed over certain parallelepipeds. In this paper, we introduce lattice enumeration with discrete pruning, which generalizes random sampling and its variants, and provides a novel geometric description based on partitions of the n-dimensional space. We obtain what is arguably the first sound analysis of random sampling, by showing how discrete pruning can be rigorously analyzed under the well-known Gaussian heuristic, in the same model as the Gama-Nguyen-Regev analysis of pruned enumeration from EUROCRYPT '10, albeit using different tools: we show how to efficiently compute the volume of the intersection of a ball with a box, and to efficiently approximate a large sum of many such volumes, based on statistical inference. Furthermore, we show how to select good parameters for discrete pruning by enumerating integer points in an ellipsoid. Our analysis is backed up by experiments and allows for the first time to reasonably estimate the success probability of random sampling and its variants, and to make comparisons with previous forms of pruned enumeration. Our work unifies random sampling and pruned enumeration and show that they are complementary of each other: both have different characteristics and offer different trade-offs to speed up enumeration.",

We illustrate this by solving within half a day a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathsf {\{}LWE{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                  LWE                                                             instance with dimension                                                                                   {\$}{\$}n=128{\$}{\$}                                                                                            n                          =                          128                                                                                    , modulus                                                                                   {\$}{\$}q=n^{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            q                          =                                                      n                            2                                                                                                              , Gaussian noise                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha =1/({\backslash}sqrt{\{}n/{\backslash}pi {\}} {\backslash}log ^2 n){\$}{\$}                                                                                            $\alpha$                          =                          1                          /                          (                                                                                    n                              /                              $\pi$                                                                                                            log                            2                                                    n                          )                                                                                     and binary secret, using                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}28{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          28                                                                                     samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time complexity of                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}74{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          74                                                                                     with                                                                                   {\$}{\$}2^{\{}60{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                                            2                          60                                                                                     samples for the same parameters.",

Our constructions are asymptotically efficient and highly parallelizable in a practical sense, i.e., they can be computed by simple, relatively small low-depth arithmetic or boolean circuits (e.g., in NC1 or even TC0). In addition, they are the first low-depth PRFs that have no known attack by efficient quantum algorithms. Central to our results is a new ``derandomization'' technique for the learning with errors (LWE) problem which, in effect, generates the error terms deterministically.",
